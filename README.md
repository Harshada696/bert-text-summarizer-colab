# Transformer-based Text Summarization Project

This project performs **abstractive text summarization** using pre-trained Transformer models such as BERT, BART, or T5. It is implemented in Google Colab with PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers, and designed to generate concise summaries from longer pieces of text.

## 📚 Overview

This is a text summarization project using a Transformer-based architecture. It leverages:

- 🤗 Hugging Face `transformers` for model/tokenizer
- 🧠 PyTorch for model implementation
- 🗂 `datasets` for optional dataset handling
- ☁️ Google Drive for storing and loading data/models

## 🧱 Architecture

## 📁 Project Structure

```text
phtmodel.ipynb       # Main Colab notebook
/data/               # (in Google Drive) Dataset directory
/models/             # (optional) Trained model checkpoints
```

## 📊 Example Dataset Format

Assuming a text classification task like sentiment analysis, your dataset (CSV or TSV) might look like:

```csv
text,label
"I love this product!",1
"This is the worst experience ever.",0
```

- `text`: The input sentence
- `label`: Numerical class label (e.g., 0 = negative, 1 = positive)

Make sure to load your dataset using `pandas`, `datasets`, or `csv` reader inside the notebook.

## 🧠 Model Training

Typical steps inside the notebook:

- Load and tokenize the dataset using `BertTokenizer`
- Create `DataLoader`s for training and validation
- Build a model using `BertModel` and a linear head
- Train using standard PyTorch loops
- Save model to Google Drive (optional)

## 📊 Example Input & Output
- Input :


The Amazon rainforest, the largest rainforest on Earth, is shrinking at an alarming rate due to deforestation caused by human activities like logging, agriculture, and mining...
- Generated Summary:
The Amazon rainforest is rapidly shrinking due to human-driven deforestation.

## 🔍 Example Inference Code

```python
def predict(text, model, tokenizer):
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True)
    with torch.no_grad():
        logits = model(**inputs)
    predicted_class = torch.argmax(logits.logits, dim=1).item()
    return predicted_class
```

## ✅ Requirements

- Google Colab
- Python 3.7+
- `transformers`
- `torch`
- `datasets`

Install inside Colab:

```python
!pip install transformers datasets torch --quiet
```

## 📌 Notes

- Switch Colab to GPU via `Runtime > Change runtime type > GPU` for better performance.
- Modify batch size and max sequence length to fit memory constraints.
